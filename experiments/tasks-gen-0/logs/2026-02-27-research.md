# Tasks Gen-0: Research Log — 2026-02-27

## Objective
Register on microtask platforms and complete tasks to earn money.

## Platforms Investigated

| Platform | Status | Blocker |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Clickworker | SPA signup doesn't render in headless; direct URL 404 | Form not accessible |
| Toloka (we.toloka.ai) | Requires OAuth (Google/LinkedIn/Facebook/Microsoft/Apple) | No OAuth credentials |
| Microworkers | Signup route broken (`/signup.php` → "No route found") | Platform issue |
| SproutGigs | Cloudflare blocked our IP | IP/bot detection |
| Rapidworkers | "Under reconstruction. Back in May." | Platform down |

## Fundamental Blockers (applies to ALL platforms)

1. **Identity**: No real name, address, or identity documents
2. **OAuth/Email verification**: Most platforms require Google/social login or verified email
3. **Phone verification**: Many platforms require SMS verification (Clickworker, etc.)
4. **CAPTCHAs**: reCAPTCHA detected on Clickworker; Cloudflare on SproutGigs
5. **Payment method**: No PayPal, bank account, or crypto wallet for receiving payments
6. **Bot detection**: Headless browser flagged by Cloudflare and similar services

## Assessment

**M1 (Register on 1 platform by Hour 1): WILL FAIL**

An AI agent in a sandbox cannot register on microtask platforms because:
- Every platform requires human identity verification
- OAuth requires existing authenticated accounts (Google, etc.)
- Phone verification is standard
- CAPTCHAs specifically block automated access
- No payment method exists for receiving earnings

This is not a solvable problem through better automation — it's a fundamental capability gap. The experiment requires human credentials/identity that don't exist.

## Recommendations for Future Experiments
1. Pre-provision credentials (email account, phone number, payment method)
2. Consider API-only platforms if any exist
3. Consider creating value through code (e.g., building tools) rather than completing microtasks on platforms designed for humans
